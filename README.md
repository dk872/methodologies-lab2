# Linked List Implementation with Unit Tests

## Decription
This project implements a list based on Python's built-in lists and a singly linked circular list in Python without using built-in collections. They include fundamental operations such as appending, inserting, deleting, reversing, and searching within the list. The implementation is accompanied by a unit test suite to ensure reliability and correctness. GitHub Actions are configured to automatically run tests.

## Calculation of the variant number
Record book number - **3214**.
Variant number = 3214 mod 4 = **2**.

The initial implementation of a list is a *list based on built-in arrays/lists*.
The second implementation of a list is a *singly linked circular list*.

## Running the program
First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/dk872/methodologies-lab2
```
```
cd methodologies-lab2
```

- **On Linux:**
  - Make sure you have Python installed. You can check with:
    ```
    python3 --version
    ```
  - Run the script:
    ```
    python3 main.py
    ```
  - Alternatively, make the script executable and run it directly:
    ```
    chmod +x main.py
    ./main.py
    ```

- **On Windows:**
  - Make sure Python is installed and added to the system PATH. You can check with:
    ```
    python --version
    ```
  - Run the script and enter coefficients *manually*:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
  - Or run the program *with the file* as an argument:
    ```
    python main.py <path-to-the-file>
    ```
